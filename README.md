# Techdegree-project-1
Mi fist project is a small web application that fetches a random quote from a pre-defined list of quotes and displays it on the screen. It adds a touch of fun and inspiration by showing different quotes every 10 seconds. I used my basic knowneldge in JavaScript syntax, variables, loops and object literals.
